# Chaos Vectors

Shoot low-res vector shapes. Upgrade cannons, detonate bombs. Protect your grid.

Endless enemy geometry shapes spawn to come and get you. Evade them. Shoot them out of the grid. Get power ups to upgrade your ship's weapons, or shield, or get an extra life. Denotate bombs when things get tight.

When Blackholes spawn, they pull everything in, including you. Shoot it out quickly. Or wait and see what happens when it grows too big.

*How low can you survive?*

Can you top 1,000,000 points? 1,000,000 points seems out of reach. But it is possible.

- Retro, Low-Res, Vector graphics
- Endless Shoot-em up

Controls:

Left, Right, Up, Down fire your weapons.
Space to explode the bomb.
